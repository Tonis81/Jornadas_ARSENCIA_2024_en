## Presentation

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><em>Health and nutrition are closely linked. The quantity and variety of foods in our diet, along with food production models currently being revised to promote greater sustainability, can influence both nutrient intake and exposure to harmful substances.
</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px;"><em>High adherence to the Mediterranean diet or other healthy plant-based food patterns over time significantly contributes to promoting good health. However, foods can also contain toxic elements, such as arsenic, whose chronic exposure, even at relatively low concentrations, can negatively impact health. Moreover, its harmful effect can be potentiated by interactions with other elements. Therefore, it is crucial to develop models to assess health risks associated with exposure to toxic agents, especially for vulnerable individuals such as pregnant women, infants, children, and the elderly.
  </em></p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><em>During these sessions, scientific evidence on the importance of diet for health, as well as exposure to toxic metals through food, will be presented, and strategies and opportunities to reduce it will be discussed. Evidence generated from ongoing projects at the Miguel Hernández University (UMH), such as ARSENCIA, part of the GenT program funded by the Generalitat Valenciana, the PREDIMED Plus study, HidroSOStoneFruit, ThinkinAzul, and a recent project on the transmission of the Mediterranean diet from mothers to children funded by the Carlos III Health Institute, will be highlighted. To achieve this goal, a dual scientific and educational approach will be adopted to facilitate interactions between undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students from various related disciplines with researchers and present their work. Additionally, participants in the studies will be given a voice to express their perceptions, ideas, and concerns about food, and explore the possibility of integrating them into future collaborative research projects.
</em></p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;"><em>With this purpose in mind, various activities have been planned, including gathering information on attendees' diets through questionnaires to evaluate their adherence to healthy eating practices, as well as presentations by renowned researchers and demonstration workshops. Based on all the information collected during the event, it is expected to develop a guide or report on good practices that will help promote the consumption of foods that contribute to a balanced and healthy diet.
